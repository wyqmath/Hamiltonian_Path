This repository is dedicated to reproducing the results presented in the paper:

**"An Efficient Algorithm for Hamiltonian Path Embedding of k-Ary nnn-Cubes Under the Partitioned Edge Fault Model"**

The paper was published in *IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems*. You can access the original publication [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10093117).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to implement and validate the algorithm proposed in the paper, which addresses the problem of Hamiltonian path embedding in k-ary nnn-cubes under the partitioned edge fault model. This algorithm is designed to efficiently handle edge faults while ensuring the construction of Hamiltonian paths in high-dimensional networks.

## Features

- Implementation of the algorithm described in the paper.
- Reproduction of experimental results to verify the claims made in the publication.
- Analysis of the algorithm's performance under various fault conditions.
